**Real-Time Stock Market Analysis**

Implemented a real-time stock market analysis system leveraging Apache Kafka for seamless data streaming and processing.

What: Developed a Python-based stock market simulation that publishes stock data (from CSV datasets) to Kafka in real-time, utilizing the AWS cloud environment for scalable data storage and querying.

How: Set up Kafka producers to simulate stock market data and integrated AWS Glue and Athena to create a centralized data catalog and perform SQL queries on the ingested data stored in S3. Used AWS Glue crawlers to automate data classification and schema creation.

Effect: Achieved real-time insights and analysis on stock market data by streaming and processing data at scale, enabling timely decision-making and improving data accessibility through automated workflows.

Tools: Python, Kafka, Amazon S3, AWS Glue, Amazon Athena, Boto3, AWS EC2.
